## Gameplay Tips
A game run is pretty short so read this when you have tried it at least once (to be able to understand the context).
- Armor is super important (halves incoming damage)
- Reactivate the tutorial by exiting to the main menu
- Trash equipment you dont need to regain stats
- Entertain the audience to get more rewards (e.g. longer battle, successfull blocks and throwing equipment on the enemy)
